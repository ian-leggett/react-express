# A simple app that runs React with a Node layer + Express.js

## Description
This can be useful if you want to run React against an API, all requests to the API can then be handled in Express via the node layer hiding your actual API requests.

## Getting started
You will need to install dependencies in both the server and client.

In the root dir run `npm install`, then in the client dir run `npm install`

Then from the root dir run `npm run dev`
